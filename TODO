TODO:

-p2p e.g. screencast
-fix chromium
-think about how to handle OTA
-kernel cmdline option for default gps device (custom init sets property then)
-support usb cameras - preview works capture not (v3d_bo_map_unsynchronized)
-screen distortion on higher resolutions (seems to be on hdmi 1 only - maybe my device port is broken)
-video playback - lets start easy with even a simple screen record (v3d_bo_map_unsynchronized)
