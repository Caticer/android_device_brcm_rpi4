TODO:

-p2p e.g. screencast
-5Ghz soft AP (does not work on a lot of phones either)
-flexible boot config for sd-card vs. usb boot e.g. kernel cmdline (fstab)
    -> first solution available using a dt overlay
-fix chromium
-think about how to handle OTA
-add device specific config options
-kernel cmdline option for default audio device (custom init sets property then)
-kernel cmdline option for default gps device (custom init sets property then)
-consider what to do with always on (ambient) display
-support usb cameras - preview works capture not (v3d_bo_map_unsynchronized)
-screen distortion on higher resolutions (seems to be on hdmi 1 only - maybe my device port is broken)
-check why GPT devices wont boot from USB
-video playback - lets start easy with even a simple screen record (v3d_bo_map_unsynchronized)
